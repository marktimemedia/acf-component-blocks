2. Copy any of the `block` or `content` template parts in the plugin `templates` folder into your `mtm-templates` folder, and modify/style them at will. The plugin will automatically override them.
3. To call any of the custom template parts from another part of your theme, use the `mtm_get_block_part()` function
